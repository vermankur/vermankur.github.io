Collection of data on different types of irrigation systems in the state has been left to different agencies. These agencies are not geared to systematic collection of statistics and the data provided by them are not regular and are often inconsistent.

Virtual water trade, or trade in water- embedded agricultural commodities, has been considered a means for countries to overcome water deficits provided they can import food rather than produce locally. Despite a rich literature, research on the subject has not reached a consensus on whether virtual water trade is actually driven by relative water endowment differentials (e.g. countries seeking to alleviate pressure on their own resources) or by comparative advantage in water utilization (e.g. countries using their most abundant and cheap factors of production). Understanding what drives virtual water trade would support water management policies in targeting the roots of water depletion: excessive use due to lack of other available inputs and bad water management due to absence of water use regulation. Using panel data of bilateral virtual water trade flows from 1994 to 2007 applied to a gravity model, we first demonstrate that arid countries do resort to trade as a means to alleviate water scarcity. Second, we demonstrate that there is much inefficiency in water use in some countries where other agricultural inputs (land, labor) are available and cheap. Given the increased urgency related to global water scarcity, our results suggest how agricultural production and trade could help countries preserve and better use precious water resources.","2020-07-01","2020-06-11 11:18:39","2020-06-11 11:18:43","2020-06-11 11:18:38","104917","","","131","","World Development","The globalization of virtual water flows","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/ankur/bibliobase/water/delbourg_dinar_2020_the_globalization_of_virtual_water_flows.pdf","","","Crop water requirements; Food security; International trade; Water endowments; Water productivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Access to affordable irrigation from solar pumps led to a 9–10% increase in productivity of rice and wheat. Furthermore, in a severe drought, farmers could grow paddy in the entire area irrigated by solar pumps, when nearly 40% of other land was left fallow.

We place the rise of this policy pathway in historical perspective. Under colonial rule, there was considerable importance placed upon public health as a local public good. After independence, the Bhore Committee build a paradigm of public sector health care, and the public health system degraded. In this environment, the political process faced a high disease burden coupled with a weak public health care system. This pressure led to the adoption of GFHIS as a convenient way forward. We identify four areas of concern in this new paradigm of Indian health policy: inefficient lack of focus upon public health, regulatory problems with private health care, weak regulation of health insurance companies, and fiscal risk.","2018-05","2020-06-11 18:09:08","2020-06-11 18:10:13","","","","Working Paper 18/231","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: National Institute of Public Finance and Policy Type: Working papers tex.referencetype: artilce","","/home/ankur/bibliobase/health/health_insurance/patnaik_et_2018_the_rise_of_government-funded_health_insurance_in_india.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It distinguishes between factors at three levels – village, household and individual – and arranges them in ascending order with respect to their proximity to infant mortality. Village and household-level factors are assumed to influence infant mortality indirectly by influencing at least one of the six individual-level factors. The present analysis of the data aggregated at the state level clearly demonstrates the importance of both medical and non-medical factors for explaining the observed regional differences in infant mortality in rural India. The percentage of births attended by trained medical personnel and poverty, are the two important determinants of regional variations in neo-natal mortality; and the village-level availability of medical facilities and the extent of triple vaccination are the two important determinants of post-neo-natal mortality. The influence of adult women's literacy on infant mortality is explained by better medical care at birth, and preventive and curative medical care during the post-neo-natal period. Medical factors have been shown to be slightly more important than non-medical factors.

The PM2.5-related health impacts are notable for megacities across the globe, but Asian megacities have been suffering much more. The Phenomenon of smog-hit cities became so common recently that the term ‘airpocalypse’ has become synonymous with polluted air. This study reports PM2.5-related long-term mortality for the year 2016 in 13 megacities of China, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan using an integrated exposure risk (IER) model. This study assesses the mortality associated with health outcomes attributable to PM2.5 particularly: cerebrovascular disease (stroke, CEV), ischemic heart disease (IHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer (LC) among adults (≥25years) and the acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) for infants (¡5years). It further provides an estimation of the potential health benefits in future years under various scenarios realizing the PM2.5 concentration levels of (a) the goals of Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan target (APPCAP) for China; (b) current policies (CP) and best practice emission control (BPEC) scenarios and (c) Interim Targets (ITs) and Air Quality Guidelines (AQG) for PM2.5 for all megacities. It is estimated that in 2016, PM2.5-related mortality in Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing, Tianjin, Guangzhou and Shenzhen was 17.6, 18.2, 10.4, 9.8, 7.6 and 6.4 thousand respectively. In Indian megacities, the premature deaths were 14.8, 10.5, 7.3, 4.8 and 4.8 thousand in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore and Chennai respectively. Total mortality in Dhaka and Karachi was estimated to be 9.1 and 7.7 thousand. The CP is not enough to protect the public health in future in all the megacities. In China, PM2.5 levels will reduce under CP but PM2.5-related deaths will increase by 14–30%, primarily due to increase in overall population growth and urban migration patterns. In other megacities, the PM2.5-related deaths will increase by 39.32 to 85% in CP scenario, mostly due to the increase of PM2.5 in CP scenario. Though China has taken initial steps with pollution control targets and strategy, there is an urgent need for government policy in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. This study highlights the need for urgency in setting up decisive air quality targets by megacity authorities and advocates for joint regional efforts to control air pollution.","2018","2020-06-11 20:18:21","2020-06-11 20:18:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: MAJI2018","","","","Asian megacity; current policies; PM pollution; premature mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Overall, just about 11per cent of households were enrolled and almost half of these households actually belonged to the non-poor category. Although the scheme has increased hospitalisation rate, we do not know if it has enabled people to access the “genuinely needed” inpatient care which they could not afford earlier or whether hospitals are inducing the demand by suggesting unnecessary inpatient care to the people. Disturbingly, it has hardly had any effects on financial protection.

In view of policy initiatives and investments made since 2000, it is important to see if there is acceleration towards the MDG 4 target. We assessed levels and trends in child mortality for 187 countries from 1970 to 2010. Methods We compiled a database of 16 174 measurements of mortality in children younger than 5 years for 187 countries from 1970 to 2009, by use of data from all available sources, including vital registration systems, summary birth histories in censuses and surveys, and complete birth histories. We used Gaussian process regression to generate estimates of the probability of death between birth and age 5 years. This is the first study that uses Gaussian process regression to estimate child mortality, and this technique has better out-of-sample predictive validity than do previous methods and captures uncertainty caused by sampling and non-sampling error across data types. Neonatal, postneonatal, and childhood mortality was estimated from mortality in children younger than 5 years by use of the 1760 measurements from vital registration systems and complete birth histories that contained specific information about neonatal and postneonatal mortality. Findings Worldwide mortality in children younger than 5 years has dropped from 11·9 million deaths in 1990 to 7·7 million deaths in 2010, consisting of 3·1 million neonatal deaths, 2·3 million postneonatal deaths, and 2·3 million childhood deaths (deaths in children aged 1–4 years). 33·0% of deaths in children younger than 5 years occur in south Asia and 49·6% occur in sub-Saharan Africa, with less than 1% of deaths occurring in high-income countries. Across 21 regions of the world, rates of neonatal, postneonatal, and childhood mortality are declining. The global decline from 1990 to 2010 is 2·1% per year for neonatal mortality, 2·3% for postneonatal mortality, and 2·2% for childhood mortality. In 13 regions of the world, including all regions in sub-Saharan Africa, there is evidence of accelerating declines from 2000 to 2010 compared with 1990 to 2000. Within sub-Saharan Africa, rates of decline have increased by more than 1% in Angola, Botswana, Cameroon, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, and The Gambia. Interpretation Robust measurement of mortality in children younger than 5 years shows that accelerating declines are occurring in several low-income countries. These positive developments deserve attention and might need enhanced policy attention and resources.

This is inevitable and yet l feel that many types of machines can be made in India if we gave thought and energy to this matter. We follow the sheer path of paying dollars and getting them from abroad. We forget that our resources are limited; we forget also how Japan industrialised herself without importing much in the way of big machines. Right from the commencement Japan tried to build her own machine and later succeeded remarkably. Another factor has to be borne in mind. When we have to buy expensive machinery from abroad .or to give contracts, we have to be particularly careful that we get the most for our money and that no opportunity is given for individuals to make private profits out of this big transactions. I say this because instances have come to my notice when such private profit has been alleged. We have, INFANT MORTALITY rate is an excellent indicator of the socio-economic development of a country. This volume of original papers comes at an opportune time and provides a comprehensive review of this vital index for India.' It is commonly believed that the infant mortality rate in India has begun to decline again since 1978 after remaining stable for a decade. The editors argue against this and postulate that infant mortality has, in fact, been declining steadily since 1947, but the pace has been slower prior to 1978. The estimate of census actuaries understand the true level of infant mortality during the 1920s and also the 1940s. The authors point out that SRS crude death rates for 1965-67 were significantly above those estimated by the NSS for 1958-59 for nine of the thirteen states for which both sources provided information. The conclusion drawn is that death rates based on the NSS are underestimated. According to the authors, after an initial rather rapid decline up to 1961, IMR is presumed to have fallen at a slower rate. The pace of decline has accelerated after 1975 because of improved ternal and child health programmes, the mansion of health services and a significant increase in the number of health functionaries. However, they hasten to add that this increase has just about kept pace with the growth of population. Besides, lack of resources, transport and communications limit access to medical care. To this may be added a lack of empathy, inadequate supplies, unsuitable timings, etc Perhaps a combined effect of more therefore, to take particular care in checking this abuse (Volume II, pp 211-12).","1988","2020-06-11 20:18:23","2020-06-11 20:18:23","","","","Issue No. 20","Vol. 23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: shanti Publisher: Economic and Political Weekly Type: Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is used to estimate the impact of total suspended particulates (TSPs) on infant mortality. We find that a 1-percent reduction in TSPs results in a 0.35 percent decline in the infant mortality rate at the county level, implying that 2500 fewer infants died from 1980-1982 than would have in the absence of the TSPs reductions. Most of these effects are driven by fewer deaths occurring within one month of birth, suggesting that fetal exposure is a potential pathophysiologic mechanism. The analysis also reveals nonlinear effects of TSPs pollution and greater sensitivity of black infant mortality at the county level. Importantly, the estimates are stable across a variety of specifications.","2003","2020-06-11 20:18:24","2020-06-11 20:18:24","","1121–1167","","3","118","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: 10.2307/25053932 Publisher: Oxford University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

State-level aggregate data from the National Family Health Survey 1992 and micro-level data on rural mothers (n=317) were used for examining the influence of female literacy on reduction of infant mortality through increased use of maternal and child health (MCH) services. Illiteracy of females was strongly associated with all variables relating to maternal care and also with infant mortality rate. States were grouped into best, medium, and worst on the basis of female illiteracy (about 11%, 48.5%, and 75% respectively). Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 livebirths) was significantly (p¡0.01) higher among the worst group (90.99) than that among the medium (64.2) and the best (24.0) groups. Use of maternal health services increased in the worst to become the best groups for tetanus toxoid (from 48.0% to 84.4%), iron and folic acid tablets (36.6% to 76.2 %), hospitalized deliveries (14.2% to 69.7%), and childcare services, such as vaccination (23.8% to 64.9%). Illiteracy of females had a more detrimental impact on rural than on urban areas. In the event of high female illiteracy, male literacy was beneficial for improving the use of services for reducing infant mortality rate. The micro-level study supported all major findings obtained for the national-level aggregate data. Programmes, like providing free education to girls, will yield long-term health benefits.","2002","2020-06-11 20:18:24","2020-06-11 20:18:24","","138–147","","2","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: 10.2307/23498935 Publisher: icddr,b","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Parents sought treatment, and coverage was 76% without active case-detection efforts. The case-fatality rate among the 612 cases treated by health workers was 0·8%, compared with 13·5% in the control area. After a year of intervention pneumoniaspecific childhood mortality was significantly lower in the intervention than in the control area (8·1 vs 17·5 deaths per 1000 children under 5 years); the difference between the areas was greatest in children under 1 year. The differences in infant mortality (89 vs 121 per 1000) and total under-5 mortality (28·5 vs 40·7 per 1000) were highly significant. Mortality from other causes remained similar in the two areas but neonatal mortality due to birth injury and prematurity was significantly lower in the intervention area, presumably owing to the combination of better maternal and neonatal care by the TBAs trained in the project and the availability of treatment for pneumonia.

A major factor is that inadequate attention has been paid to improved health care practices within the home. Women's autonomy, social class, and mothers' education significantly influence child survival. One of the pathways by which mothers' education affects child survival is through improved child care. In this society, a woman's autonomy is lowest during that part of her life-cycle which also contains her peak childbearing years: this perverse overlap raises child mortality. The risk of dying is distributed very unevenly amongst children, as the majority of child deaths are clustered amongst a small proportion of the families. The death-clustering variable remained significant even after several possible biological and socio-economic reasons for clustering had been controlled. It is argued that this clustering of deaths is partly due to the poor basic abilities of some mothers and other carers.","1990","2020-06-11 20:18:26","2020-06-12 08:09:04","","489-505","","3","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: doi:10.1080/0032472031000144866 Publisher: Routledge tex.eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/0032472031000144866","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Every year an estimated 4 million babies die in the first 4 weeks of life (the neonatal period). A similar number are stillborn, and 0·5 million mothers die from pregnancy-related causes. Three-quarters of neonatal deaths happen in the first week—the highest risk of death is on the first day of life. Almost all (99%) neonatal deaths arise in low-income and middle-income countries, yet most epidemiological and other research focuses on the 1% of deaths in rich countries. The highest numbers of neonatal deaths are in south-central Asian countries and the highest rates are generally in sub-Saharan Africa. The countries in these regions (with some exceptions) have made little progress in reducing such deaths in the past 10–15 years. Globally, the main direct causes of neonatal death are estimated to be preterm birth (28%), severe infections (26%), and asphyxia (23%). Neonatal tetanus accounts for a smaller proportion of deaths (7%), but is easily preventable. Low birthweight is an important indirect cause of death. Maternal complications in labour carry a high risk of neonatal death, and poverty is strongly associated with an increased risk. Preventing deaths in newborn babies has not been a focus of child survival or safe motherhood programmes. While we neglect these challenges, 450 newborn children die every hour, mainly from preventable causes, which is unconscionable in the 21st century.

Changes in use of, and rights and access to, land and water are most acutely experienced in peri-urban areas. We analyze these changes in peri-urban Kathmandu, Nepal. Increasing pressures on land and growing water needs of an expanding population in Kathmandu Valley are creating new patterns of water use, water-related conflicts, and (in)securities. We use two case studies that are characteristic of these changes, with a focus on the microlevel redefinitions of, and struggles about, rights, access, and notions of legitimate water use, and what these mean for water security and water conflict in a socially and institutionally complex and dynamic environment. Our findings show that these water-related changes cause contestations and conflicts between peri-urban water users. Amid increasing competition for water, people are using new sources and technologies, searching for negotiated solutions based on local norms and rights, and co-opting other water users through cooperation to create access opportunities and avoid conflicts. Our cases show self-restraint in practices of claiming or accessing water, while avoidance of conflicts also derives from an awareness of unequal power relations between user groups, past experiences of violence used against protesters, and lack of active intervention to regulate increasing exploitation of peri-urban land and water resources.","2018","2020-06-12 08:32:30","2020-06-12 08:32:34","2020-06-12 08:32:30","","","2","23","","","Flows of change","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Resilience Alliance Inc.","","/home/ankur/bibliobase/phd/shrestha_et_2018_flows_of_change.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An outmoded agrarian structure is a serious obstacle to the modernisation of agriculture and rapid rural development. Such a structure is to be squarely blamed for the unequal distribution of the fruits of development leading to widening of the disparities in income and wealth. The upper classes who have cornered the bulk of the new prosperity have also succeeded in consolidating their political power. Consequently, it has become still more difficult to adopt and implement far-reaching institutional reforms. Even so, as the emerging agrarian structure has become a serious constraint to rural development it will be disastrous to postpone the much-needed institutional reforms.","1974","2020-06-12 08:40:25","2020-06-12 08:40:32","2020-06-12 08:40:25","A70-A75","","39","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Economic and Political Weekly","","/home/ankur/bibliobase/phd/agrarian_structure/appu_1974_agrarian_structure_and_rural_development.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The state did record high growth rates of cereal yields during the 1980s, higher than the national figures. However, this promising development could not be sustained in the 1990s, and cereal yields have stagnated since then. Based on fieldwork in eight villages of Bihar, the paper argues that, more than agrarian structure, the lack of adequate infrastructure and economic incentives has contributed to the agrarian stagnation in Bihar. The growth potential unleashed by the expansion of shallow tubewell irrigation has been constrained by (a) complete neglect of public sector investments in physical and institutional infrastructure and (b) unfavourable output to factor price ratios.","2004","2020-06-12 08:41:13","2020-06-12 08:41:13","2020-06-12 08:41:13","3484-3491","","31","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Economic and Political Weekly","","/home/ankur/bibliobase/phd/kishore_2004_understanding_agrarian_impasse_in_bihar.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The government alone has invested about Rs. 1556 billion (in current prices) in the irrigation sector as of 2001–2002. The irrigated area has increased from 20.9 million ha in 1950–1951 to 78.4 million ha in 2002–2003, an increase of almost four times. A large number of studies have analysed the impact of irrigation on various parameters. However, not many studies have analysed the direction of changes in the irrigated area across major sources and states. Therefore, an in-depth analysis on the trends and development of irrigation is essential to frame appropriate irrigation policies for the future. In this study, an attempt is made to analyse the past development of the irrigated area across states using time series data from 1950–1951 to 2002–2003. This study shows that the growth in irrigated area across the states and sources has decelerated substantially during the post-green revolution period (1980–1981 to 2002–2003) as compared to the green revolution period (1965–1966 to 1980–1981). The low-cost source of irrigation, namely tanks, has declined sharply since the mid-1960s, which may create livelihood problems for farmers relying on this source.

Effective conflict resolution calls for a consensual, multi-stakeholder effort from the grassroots upwards.","2006","2020-06-12 08:56:43","2020-06-12 08:56:43","2020-06-12 08:56:43","570-574","","7","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Economic and Political Weekly","","/home/ankur/bibliobase/phd/gujja_et_2006_'million_revolts'_in_the_making.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The excuse that water is a state subject and thus central government cannot do much is not valid. States have always been a party to the formulation of the NWP. They have the freedom to modify the NWP to suit their individual requirements. Many states have adopted a state water policy. Even such state-level policies have failed to make any significant impact in improving their water management practices. Neither the NWP nor the state water policies have made any impact on practice. Reasons for the NWP basically being a paper exercise are many, including lofty drafting and policy prescriptions that are divorced from reality; lack of courage at the Water Ministry to take a firm stand on any of the provisions at either the drafting or the implementation stages; the practice of keeping specialists away from policies; and the dominance of generalists who have neither a demonstrable understanding of the complexities of the water sector nor a long-term commitment to it.","2019-11-02","2020-06-12 08:58:39","2020-06-12 08:58:42","2020-06-12 08:58:39","1015-1028","","6","35","","","India’s National Water Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/07900627.2019.1576509","","/home/ankur/bibliobase/water/pandit_biswas_2019_india’s_national_water_policy.pdf","","","India; development; governance; National Water Policy; policy impacts; water management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study adopted a systems-modelling approach to analyzing the informal tanker market in India. The results indicate that the demand for tanker supply was caused by lack of groundwater availability in private wells as well as unreliable piped supply. The study shows that two groundwater factors are relevant: depth to water and aquifer productivity. Together, these could explain the difference in spatial, temporal and consumer-specific variations in tanker dependence.","2010-06-15","2020-06-12 08:59:55","2020-06-12 08:59:55","2020-06-12 08:59:55","254-269","","3","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/02508060.2010.487931","","/home/ankur/bibliobase/water/srinivasan_et_2010_factors_determining_informal_tanker_water_markets_in_chennai,_india.pdf","","","India; informal; tanker; urban; water market","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ayushman Bharat is a step towards creating a system that would facilitate in relinquishing public funds and public institutions to already dominant private players, which will have serious implications for the healthcare delivery system in India.","2020-05-20","2020-07-01 20:28:37","2020-07-01 20:29:48","","","","Issue No. 25","Vol. 55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Economic and Political Weekly Type: Journal","","/home/ankur/bibliobase/health/health_insurance/hooda_2020_decoding_ayushman_bharat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
